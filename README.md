## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

For future projects, I want to explore creating a form schema, using a library like [Yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup) or [Zod](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod).

### Useful resources

- [Regex Example](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/regex-for-date-formats-what-is-the-regular-expression-for-matching-dates/) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Validation Example](https://catalins.tech/react-forms-with-react-hook-form/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
